- 👋 Hi, I’m @olmansju
- 👀 I’m interested in 1) developing computational, mathematical, and linguistic literacies; 2) transdisciplinary constructionist learning; and 3) culturally or neurologically divergent practices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning statecharts, and advanced cypher. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the design of new technologies to support learning (see above).
- 📫 How to reach me olmansju@gmail.com or my University of Nebraska Lincoln email address jolmanson2@unl.edu
