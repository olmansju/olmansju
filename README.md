- 👋 Hi, I’m @olmansju
- 👀 I’m interested in the use of data science, artificial intelligence (e.g., NLP + ML), and learning analytics in the design of new ways to learn and support learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different python ML packages, multivariate calculus, and tableau. I'm also starting to dabble in Haskell. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the design of new ways to support the learningn of difficult concepts (e.g., literacy development in logosyllabic and abjad languages, advanced mathematics, ect).
- 📫 How to reach me olmansju@gmail.com or my University of Nebraska Lincoln email address
